Beta 1
------
- added client-side dynamic script compiler for Ajax applications
- added threading library and simplified API
- added java-based compiler using Rhino
- added web version of test suite
- added new algorithm for stack manipulation that is more like lua-style
  coroutines, less like CPS transformation.  (this change fixes a design problem
  where a non-yielding method called with the yielding operator would result
  in a truncated thread that never completes.)
- functions containing no yielding try/catch blocks are no longer wrapped with
  a try/catch block
- added support for yielding within switch blocks
- fixed compilation of += in Internet Explorer
- made it possible to call a yielding constructor
- put narcissus into single file/object to reduce global namespace pollution
- fix bug where single-statement blocks not enclosed in curlies wouldn't show
  up in the output

Alpha 2
-------
- added notifier API
- added support for exceptions (blocking within try/catch/finally blocks)
- added --exceptions flag to compiler to turn on/off exception support 
  (default is "on")
- added sample compilation in docs via web page
- incorporated patch from chocolateboy that allows $ in variable names, 
  disallows `
- updated parser to properly handle non-tab, space, or newline whitespace
- fixed array initialization bug that left out comma separators
- fixed bug in scoping/nesting of both sync and async methods
- fixed identifier resolution problems in for and while blocks
- fixed identifier resolution problems for the dot operator and object 
  property init

Alpha 1
-------
- initial Narrative JavaScript release
